# Original Author's ReadMe

PokeClassic is a recreation of Pokemon Yellow, recreated in the Pokemon Emerald engine. Revisit your classic adventures through Kanto with new features, questlines, and post game content!

## Getting PokeClassic
This repository builds the following ROM:

* pokeemerald.gba `sha1: 8C19F2555E10DFF32A9914CEAC360B018AF42E6C`

To compile this rom yourself, see [Pret's Installation Guide](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/blob/master/INSTALL.md) on how to get started with the decompilations. Then, clone this branch and build the rom.

Otherwise, patch files will occasionaly be released here. These will be slower to release than pulling updates yourself. To patch this game, you will need to provide your own rom.
